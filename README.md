See [SEED-README.md](./SEED-README.md).

The reason to keep this file as a placeholder is this: This is a seed repository. The real readme (`SEED-README.md`) will contain instructions on how to use this repo to create a Chrome extension. Having `README.md` as a placeholder allows the forked repositories to have their own readme while keeping the seed's readme for easy reference.
